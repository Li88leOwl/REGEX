# REGEX
The Swiss Army Knife for Text Matching
Regex is a language for searching and matching text patterns. It’s used to:
**Validate inputs (e.g. email, phone number)
Find or extract text (e.g. dates, numbers)
Replace patterns (e.g. censor bad words)**
It’s supported in Python (via the re module), JavaScript, and most languages.
